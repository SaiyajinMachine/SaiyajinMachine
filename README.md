# Hello, World! 

## About Me

After a few years stuck inside the side quest whirlpool that may spawn after finishing college, I have seen a lot and been in a state of constant change. As someone who loves new challenges, deciding to finally head back to main quest territory by joining a 14-week intensive bootcamp to become a programmer without any previous experience was a really enticing and awesome idea. It was a straightforward decision, one I am very delighted to have made.

Extremely energetic and cheerful, I am constantly at full speed. I am very passionate when it comes to learning, as I get excited about almost everything. I am best described as always having two tabs open in my mind simultaneously: one in the Matrix and the other right here alongside you all.

## Interests

Having a million hobbies is a fact, but you will mostly see me devouring Manga or happily enjoying the life of a JRPG hero when I am not in full Neo mode.

## Let's Collaborate!

Feel free to invite me to projects or challenge me with new puzzles. It's where I thrive, and I am always with an adventurous spirit and up to reaching new heights!
